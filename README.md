# PLAGUE-SPOTTER by PREMAP

This repository contains a application that provides a COVID-19 data visualizer by country. It was made using React and Google Maps React and makes requests for a third-party API and a JSON file that contains all the data to be manipulated. <br />

We plan to implement some improvements, like populational density and CO2 emition data, and show relational graphics using these data.

## How to use

Clone/Download this repository, then run:

### `npm install`

And:

### `npm start`

This will start the application at:

### `http://localhost:3000`
